## Movie Recommender 

A web app that integrates a movie recommendation system. Newly registered users are asked to rate (from one to five) movies that are randomly selected from those present in the `ml-latest-small` dataset. After selecting at least ten of these, the Surprise library is used to provide recommendations. The approach adopted is collaborative filtering item-based nearest-neighbor.
